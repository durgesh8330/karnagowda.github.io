I study the relationship between structure and function in microbial communities through experimental and statistical genomics approaches.\nLife is biochemistry, and microbes are nature\u0026rsquo;s premier biochemists, impacting all life from microscopic to global scales. A revolution in sequencing and computation has enabled us to observe the who (taxonomy) and the what (functional genomics) of natural microbial communities as never before. A major task that remains is to turn this wealth of information into predictive insights about how communities organize and operate, quantitatively and dynamically.\nIn general terms, the questions I am asking are:\n Given sequence data from a community (structure), how can we predict the biochemical fluxes of important metabolites (function) in that community? How do we design communities with defined metabolic functions? What can sequence information teach us about the natural history of organisms, communities, and metabolic pathways?  I was a James S. McDonnell Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow with Seppe Kuehn in the Department of Physics at the University of Illinois from 2017-2020. Prior to that, I completed a PhD in Applied Mathematics at Northwestern University with Mary Silber, where I worked on pattern formation and geospatial data analysis relating to dryland ecology.\nUPDATES\n August 2020 - Excited to join the Department of Ecology \u0026amp; Evolution and the Center for the Physics of Evolving Systems at U.

Understanding when and how generalists or specialists evolve is therefore an important question in evolutionary dynamics. Here we study the evolution of bacterial range expansions by selecting Escherichia coli for faster migration through porous media containing one of four diﬀerent sugars supporting growth and chemotaxis. We ﬁnd that selection in any one sugar drives the evolution of faster migration in all sugars relative to the ancestral strain. Measurements of growth and motility of all evolved lineages in all nutrient conditions reveal that the ubiquitous evolution of fast migration arises via phenotypic plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity permits evolved strains to exploit distinct phenotypic strategies to achieve fast migration in each environment irrespective of the environment in which they were evolved. Our work suggests that plasticity plays an important role in the evolution of generalist phenotypes.","tags":null,"title":"Evolution of generalists by phenotypic plasticity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karna Gowda","Sarah Iams","Mary Silber"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543622400,"objectID":"e91535a77c701b9a1d4de4c1bdc332ab","permalink":"https://karnagowda.github.io/publication/gowda-signatures-2018/","publishdate":"2020-05-10T13:35:40.989749Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gowda-signatures-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Signatures of human impact on self-organized vegetation in the Horn of Africa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Punit Gandhi","Lucien Werner","Sarah Iams","Karna Gowda","Mary Silber"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"89d1770d92a8990c24530762504c5cd3","permalink":"https://karnagowda.github.io/publication/gandhi-topographic-2018/","publishdate":"2020-05-10T13:35:40.988784Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gandhi-topographic-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A topographic mechanism for arcing of dryland vegetation bands","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karna Gowda","Yuxin Chen","Sarah Iams","Mary Silber"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1456790400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1456790400,"objectID":"bfebb5fe6ab07c6f25ff096edbf800a8","permalink":"https://karnagowda.github.io/publication/gowda-assessing-2016/","publishdate":"2020-05-10T13:35:40.990399Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gowda-assessing-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Assessing the robustness of spatial pattern sequences in a dryland vegetation model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karna Gowda","Christian Kuehn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1430438400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1430438400,"objectID":"a7c29a3593aae69a3a5b726721aff983","permalink":"https://karnagowda.github.io/publication/gowda-early-warning-2015/","publishdate":"2020-05-10T13:35:40.989288Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gowda-early-warning-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"There have been signiﬁcant recent advances in our understanding of the potential use and limitations of early-warning signs for predicting drastic changes, so called critical transitions or tipping points, in dynamical systems. A focus of mathematical modeling and analysis has been on stochastic ordinary differential equations, where generic statistical earlywarning signs can be identiﬁed near bifurcation-induced tipping points. In this paper, we outline some basic steps to extend this theory to stochastic partial differential equations with a focus on analytically characterizing basic scaling laws for linear SPDEs and comparing the results to numerical simulations of fully nonlinear problems. In particular, we study stochastic versions of the Swift–Hohenberg and Ginzburg–Landau equations. We derive a scaling law of the covariance operator in a regime where linearization is expected to be a good approximation for the local ﬂuctuations around deterministic steady states. We compare these results to direct numerical simulation, and study the inﬂuence of noise level, noise color, distance to bifurcation and domain size on early-warning signs.","tags":null,"title":"Early-warning signs for pattern-formation in stochastic partial differential equations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karna Gowda","Hermann Riecke","Mary Silber"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1391212800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1391212800,"objectID":"91cb983b5bdd6e07c6bb299ffea03398","permalink":"https://karnagowda.github.io/publication/gowda-transitions-2014/","publishdate":"2020-05-10T13:35:40.990841Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gowda-transitions-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Transitions between patterned states in vegetation models for semiarid ecosystems","type":"publication"}]
